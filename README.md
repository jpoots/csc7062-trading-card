## Starting the system
After loading the database (40259713.sql) and starting it, run api/serverfuncs/index.js directory and app/serverfuncs/app.js. If you have any issues with connecting to the database on your machine, you may modify the details in the API's .env file. The site can then be accessed locally on port 3000 and the API on port 4000. You may change either of these by changing the details in the .env files. Not that if you change the API port, you should change the API address in the app's .env.

## API
The API is protected and requires a key. One for the main app is held in the .env file. A number of operations require an admin key. A new admin key may be generated by running generateKey.js in the root of the API folder. Alternatively you may use: b3a2d98e-e343-4281-bd07-ddef37d978df, pass this in the headers as x-api-key.

JSON responses will be given in the form:

{
    status code,
    message,
    response*,
}

The status code adheres to HTTP standards, the message indicates succcess or an appropriate failure message. Where appropriate, data is also returned in response.
